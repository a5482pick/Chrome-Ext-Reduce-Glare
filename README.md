A basic Chrome extension to darken and soften the majority of the background, and to 'grey' the most relevant text. &nbsp;The script injects automatically, and any frames that were missed by this initial injection may be coloured by clicking the extension's icon. &nbsp; If you wish to instead always inject the code selectively, you can use only the icon by removing the line _"js": ["background2.js"]_ from file _manifest.json_.


A commented-out content script template is included for demonstration/education.
