A quick Chrome extension to darken the majority of the background, and to 'grey' the most relevant text. &nbsp;The script injects automatically, but you can instead inject the code selectively using the icon by removing the line _"js": ["background2.js"]_ from file _manifest.json_.


A commented-out content script template is included for demonstration/education.
